This is code for the SLLE algorithm detailed in article
L. Ziegelmeier, M. Kirby, C. Peterson, "Sparse Locally Linear Embedding,"
Procedia Computer Science, 108C (2017), pages 635-644.

To solve the quadratic program to induce sparsity in the weight vector associated to nearest neighbors of a point, we use the Primal Dual Interior Point algorithm, code included as well.
